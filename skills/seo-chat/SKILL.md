# SEO Chat

Query the SEO Chat API for cited SEO answers. Every response includes inline [N] citations mapping to verified sources.

## Setup

API key is in `.env` as `SEO_CHAT_API_KEY`.
Base URL: `https://basic-peccary-254.convex.site`

## Endpoints

### Ask an SEO question
```bash
curl -X POST https://basic-peccary-254.convex.site/api/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SEO_CHAT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How do I optimize for Google AI Overviews?", "expertiseLevel": "expert", "responseFormat": "detailed"}'
```

### Audit a URL
```bash
curl -X POST https://basic-peccary-254.convex.site/api/analyze-url \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SEO_CHAT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

### Search raw sources
```bash
curl -X POST https://basic-peccary-254.convex.site/api/sources \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SEO_CHAT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "core web vitals ranking factor"}'
```

### Batch queries (up to 10)
```bash
curl -X POST https://basic-peccary-254.convex.site/api/batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SEO_CHAT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"queries": [{"query": "..."}, {"query": "..."}]}'
```

## Citation Format

Responses include inline [N] citations: [1] = sources[0], [2] = sources[1].

## When to Use

- Before writing any content: query for topic-specific SEO best practices
- Before deploying a page: audit the URL for SEO issues
- When planning content strategy: batch query multiple topics
- When the growth agent needs data-driven SEO decisions (not generic advice)

## Key Principle

AI slop ranks poorly because it lacks unique perspective and data. Good SEO content needs:
1. **Unique data** that only this SaaS generates (usage stats, benchmarks, comparisons)
2. **Unique perspective** informed by actual expertise (not regurgitated advice)
3. **Citations** from authoritative sources (this API provides them)

Never generate generic SEO content. Always query this API first for sourced, expert-level guidance.
